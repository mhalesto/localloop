Hi [First Name],

We're excited to announce something special: **LocalLoop Gold** is here!

🌟 **What's New?**

✨ **AI Post Composer**
Write engaging neighborhood posts in seconds. Choose from 4 tones, 3 lengths, with smart hashtag suggestions.

🎨 **Vision-Personalized Cartoons**
Create cartoon avatars that actually look like you! GPT-4o Vision analyzes your photo for truly personalized results. HD quality included.

📝 **GPT-4o Summaries**
4 style options: Professional, Casual, Emoji, or Formal. Way better than free AI tools.

💬 **Smart Comment Suggestions**
Get context-aware comment suggestions that fit the conversation perfectly.

🌍 **Cultural Translation**
Translate to 11 South African languages with cultural context and natural phrasing.

💰 **Amazing Value**

ChatGPT Plus costs $20/month for similar AI. With LocalLoop Gold, you get all this PLUS your community features for just **R150/month** (~$10).

🎁 **Try It Free**

We're offering a **7-day free trial** - no credit card required!

[Try Gold Free for 7 Days]
